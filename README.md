# Use Python to send complex emails. Add HTML, and various types of attachments. 
  
 A way to send an email, formatted and styled with HTML, with the ability to add many types of attachments. Including but not limited to Images, PDFs, csvs, excel files, txt files, python files.  
  
`info.txt` file contains a few fake accounts, but formatted in a way, such that it can be parsed in the main python file, and the name of the person one wishes to send an email to, can be used as the key to grap their email account  
This is of course, just one of many ways to store contact info. Better to aviod hardcoding the contact data in the actual python script.   
  
 `youtube.txt` file can have as many youtube video's as one wishes, the url of each video, to be placed on a newline. The main python file, will randomly select a video from the list, to send as the person's 'youtube video of the day'.
