# Use Python to send complex emails. Add HTML, and various types of attachments. 
  
 A way to send an email, formatted and styled with HTML, with the ability to add many types of attachments. Including but not limited to Images, PDFs, csvs, excel files, txt files, python files.  
  
`info.txt` file contains a few fake accounts, but formatted in a way, such that it can be read in the main python file, and converted to a dictionary; with the name of the person one wishes to send an email to, being the key to their email account   
This is of course, just one of many ways to store contact info. But it's a good idea to aviod hardcoding the literal contact data in the actual python script.   
  
 `youtube.txt` file can have as many youtube video's as one wishes, the url of each video, to be placed on a newline. The main python file, will randomly select a video from the list, to send as the person's 'youtube video of the day'.
